    /// assumption that there is physics involved for the movement so that the resulting AI outputs are smoothed over
    /// time through using forces. It rotates the forward vector of the agent towards the direction decided by the AI
    /// and translates along. Requires an <see cref="AIMContext"/> and <see cref="Rigidbody"/> component. If <see
    /// cref="Context"/> or <see cref="Body"/> are <c>null</c>, this controller attempts to get these components in the
    /// OnEnable method. If they are still <c>null</c>, the controller will stay disabled.
