# ChainBlade
Current working title: Shadow Links

Far into the future of a fantasy universe, existence as we know it has ended. Worlds in every plane have been sundered and all that remains are shards drifting in the Aether. Remnants of civilization cling to some of these shards held together by huge darkened iron chains called the "Shadow Links" infused with the last wisps of magic channeled by the ancients. Pirates wonder the aether currents praying on the least defended of these shard cities. Miners rip valuable resources from huge islands that look eerily like the husks of some long dead unimaginably large titans. The God's are gone and only the most learned of scholars are aware that they ever ruled over the world's lost uncountable eons ago.

It is a place bound by the chains of the past.
